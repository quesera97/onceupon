“all roads lead to you” is a visual creative non-fiction essay that serves as a tribute to the artist's past selves, who brought her to places and people that shaped who she is today. Curated with an opposite-minded ethos than Instagram, the project celebrates the power of quiet moments to change us; places which commonly remain out of sight and out of mind; obscurity as privacy (and therefore luxury) and the undersharing of concrete personal details in favor of abstract personal philosophies.
